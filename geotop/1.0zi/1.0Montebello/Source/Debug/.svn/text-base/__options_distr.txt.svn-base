/** 5 block - SPECIAL OUTPUT PARAMETERS
It is possible to select some days for which energy balance and meteo data are plotted with a very short time step. 
This is useful if some careful analyses has to be done. If you do not want to use this possibility, just write 0 as first
component of this vector.
